# gp360-mern-book-search-engine

Summary:

Hello, This project takes an alreay exsisting fully functioning Books API search powered engine by google that was built with a RESTful API. I refactored the code it to use a GraphQL API built with the Apollo Server depenency. The full scale of the application was design with MERN stack model in mind by taking a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API to fully optimize all components involved to successly build a fuctioning HTML page and allowing the user to store their information locally by inputing in thier email and other information and both logging in and out of the website. The deployed app will be housed
using Heroku.

Installation:

To use this app npm init has to be called to create your package.json file.
All necessary npm dependencies must be installed in order to run the app properly and can be found on the package.json file.
From there you must create a cluster on Mongodb atlas in order to install the database into your app.
Finally once you have verified all components are functional run "npm start" for the port to start listening with mongoose and then deploy your app to heroku.
